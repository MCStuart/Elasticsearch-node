This project is a tutorial build from scotch.io using Node.js, Vue.js, and Elasticsearch to create a real-time search engine to quickly and dynamically query sample data (global cities). [Link](https://scotch.io/tutorials/build-a-real-time-search-engine-with-node-vue-and-elasticsearch)

localhost:3001 will display a server-side query with Elasticsearch

localhost:3001/v2 will display a client-side query with Elasticsearch (Must bypass CORS for example to work)
